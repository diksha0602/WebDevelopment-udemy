    <h1>Colour Systems</h1>
    <h2>RGB System</h2>
    <p>
      We only have a limited amount of NAMED colours. As obviously it is
      practically impossible to name every colour available. Nowadays a normal
      computer is capable of displaying 16000000 different colours. So we could
      used something called as rgb() system of colours. In this we can give
      numbers ranging from 0-255 for red green and blue. every possible colour
      is made using these three colours in different proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use colour pickers online or on your system to select the colour
      you want.
    </p>
    <h3>I am rgb(252, 186, 3)</h3>
    <h4>I am rgb(3, 252, 244)</h3>
    <h5>I am rgb(92, 150, 114)</h3>
<div class="look">
    <h2>Hexadecimal System</h2>
    <p>The only diff b/w the RGB ones and the hexadecimal ones is that the numbers 0-255 can be written in more compact form using the hexadecimal numbers i.e 0-9 and then A,B,C,D,E,F(10-15).the min number can be 00 to FF.
        The hexadecimal numbers conatins 6 digits the first 2 are of red and so on.
        FF in hexadecimal mean 255 in decimal number system.
